    <h3> My Story Of How I Became A kArEN </h3>

    <p> So... let's sTaRT! I was walking down the shop aisle at Walmart, and I see a woman with a perfect HaIrCUt! It was about 10 years ago, CoVId was around for more than a year, and everyone was wearing masks. Well, I decided to take a pic of her
      HaiRCUt, and I did, but the minute she saw me, she called security. I knew we were meant to be women named kAreNs, so I ran and drove away. Next day, I get the same HaIrCUt, and I go back to that store, and see a woman taking a picture of me, I
      called security. That's my Story! I kept on doing in and still am today! Be kAreNs people, and join my kArEN ArMY!!! </p>
